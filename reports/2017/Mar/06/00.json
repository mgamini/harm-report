The order revokes the previous executive order on the same subject issued on January 27th.\nThis order removes Iraq from the list of suspended countries, removes language favoring non-Muslim religious minorities, provides exemptions for lawful permanent residents, and provides a 10-day window for implementation.",

With many communities in the US suffering from a lack of physicians already, the EO exacerbates the existing problem, prevents physicians from entering the US in the immediate term, and discourages them and other high-skilled immigrants from wanting to immigrate to the US in the future.",

Companies that employ high-skilled workers from overseas are already beginning to move operations to other countries which have friendlier immigration policies, such as Canada. This also may cause a 'brain drain' of high-skilled immigrants, who will opt to move away from or to never immigrate to the United States to avoid such restrictive policies.",
